# Copy Page Hierarchy for Confluence Cloud

Copy Page Hierarchy for Confluence Cloud is an add-on in the Atlassian marketplace. It extends Confluence's core functionality by allowing to copy pages together with their entire hierarchy of subpages.

The present repository is used to track issues and feature requests coming up during the usage of that add-on. You can create issues right [here](https://github.com/petereigenschink/confluence-cloud-copy-page-hierarchy-issues/issues).
